This is a full-stack webshop application built using Angular (frontend) and Spring Boot (backend). The primary goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of Angular and Spring Boot by applying them in a real-world-style scenario. It's a learning focused project aimed at improving my skills in frontend-backend integration, RESTful API development, and full-stack architecture.
